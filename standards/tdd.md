# Decentraland TDD

## Introduction

We encourage our developers to use TDD. The best approach is using common sense and making somenthing readable and maintanable. Think about our tests as the documentation of the projects.

## Bug Fixing

The rule for bug fixing follows the next steps:

1. Try to reproduce the bug making a test. If the test is taking too long to develop or too complex to maintain, we can avoid making a test in this case. If you can't reproduce the bug in a in any way, manually or with a test, ask yourself about priorities.
2. Program your fix for the bug.
3. When the test passes, everything works as expected.
